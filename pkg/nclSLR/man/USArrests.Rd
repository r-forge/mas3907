\description{
This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents for 
assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given 
is the percent of the population living in urban areas and the Census 
Bureau-designated region
}
\note{
USArrests contains the data as in McNeil's monograph. For the UrbanPop 
percentages, a review of the table (No. 21) in the Statistical Abstracts 1975 
reveals a transcription error for Maryland (and that McNeil used the same 
``round to even'' rule that R's round() uses), as found by Daniel S Coven 
(Arizona).
